The second most important page. A selection of photos from previous work. No text content.

### Contact

Primary contact links. This is email, instagram and WhatsApp.

This is the only page where there is some text content. There are a few paragraphs about my background.

## Features

- Framer motion in use across the whole site to animate page animations and content in and out of the page.
